> A visualisation of how automatic car park systems should work, touchless. Don't actually use this.

Using MongoDB (+ Mongoose), this is a simple visualisation of how future car parks should work. Inspired by this smart car park next to a shop:

Doesn't really look like much, doesn't it? Well, this car park uses OCR technology to read your license plate and automatically opens the gate for the user. No cards, no tickets. When the user leaves the car park, the procedure is repeated, but the user is required to pay. All without a human present! Wow! While I am unable to reproduce this technology because this is a really quick project, it definitely _is_ possible, I am able to throw together the basics of what this car park's system does.

When I discovered that car park, I thought, why not replicate this? After picking up _some_ [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) knowledge, I thought why not use it?

This is the project. Welcome to Autopark.
